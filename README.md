# RPGBannerHouse
Welcome to the new and improved RPG Banner House repo!!
This new and improved version of the original game's draft formerly known as Banner House, will contain a change in art work, screens, story board and characters. 
This game is put together by students who're part of the Game Dev Club at San Jose State University (SJSU).
Game is still going through its development phases and is intended to be played on a multi-platform scale. 
Summary of the story board so far:
    You're part of a long forgotten guild and will have to explore the 7 different realms in pursuit of answers. Along your journey you will meet interesting NPC's and
    get to complete interesting quests. Each quest helps level up your character and earn interesting rewards, coins, crystals and armor drops. This is more of an 
    exploratory than a combat heavy RPG game.
